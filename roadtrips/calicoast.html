        <h6>The California Coast is a one-way road trip with some of the best scenery in the U.S. You can start from either end of the state, but I enjoy going from north to south the best. Because this road trip is over 1,100 miles it’s nearly impossible to do everything unless you have at least 2 weeks. Most of the time I recommend doing either the northern coast from Crescent City to San Francisco or the southern coast from Monterey to San Diego. No matter what parts of this trip you choose to see, it will be stunning and awe-inspiring. Whether you want to spend some time in nature or in the big city, you will be able to find your perfect scene along the California Coast!</h6>
