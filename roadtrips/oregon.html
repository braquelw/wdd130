        <h6>The Oregon road trip is best done as a loop, and contains some of the most awe-inspiring scenery in the U.S. You can start from anywhere along the loop, but since we drive in from the east, we typically start in the Bend area. This road trip is easily broken into smaller sections and is hard to fit everything in unless you have 2 weeks or more, but we are going to show you all our favorite spots so you can pick what interests you the most. When visiting Oregon, we often take our bikes, kayaks, and plenty of hiking gear. No matter what journey you choose to take, it will be an epic experience that gives you plenty of memories!</h6>

                <h5>Deschutes County Area</h5>
                <h6>Bend</h6>
                <p>World-famous for its outdoor recreation and unspoiled beauty, Bend is a great place to spend a few days. Float the Deschutes River, hike Pilot Butte, explore the Lava River Cave, bike to Benham Falls, visit Tumalo Falls, or explore the magnificent city.</p>
                <p>To the south, visit Cascade Lakes National Scenic Byway. This 66-mile drive will take between 3 to 5 hours and is scattered with alpine lakes and snowcapped mountains. A favorite hike here is the Ray Atkson Loop Trail that is 2.3 miles long and located near Sparks Lake.</p>

                <h6>Sisters</h6>
                <p>The town of Sisters is full of lakes, mountains, and rivers. It is a paradise for hikers, fishermen, paddlers, bikers, skiers, and horseback riders. There is no shortage of places to explore here, and the town is full of culture, events, and mom-and-pop shops. Nearby visit the McKenzie Hwy where you can do a 2.2-mile waterfall loop hike and see Sahalie and Koosah Falls. We always like to visit Clear Lake and take a paddle on the crystal-clear water where you can easily view the forest preserved in the water.</p>
                <h6>Painted Hills & Smith Rock State Park</h6>
                <p>If you’re up for a drive, visit the nearby Painted Hills or Smith Rock State Park that will both stun you with their beauty. If you want a challenge, hike the 5.5-mile Misery Ridge Trail and experience the magnificent views of the valley and peaks of this gorgeous valley. </p>

                <h6>Crater Lake</h6>
                <p>Known as the deepest lake in the U.S., Crater Lake will stun you with its blue water and surrounding beauty. There are multiple viewpoints, picnic areas, hiking trails, and a scenic rim drive. Cruise the lake on a boat cruise and visit the gift shop while you are here.</p>
                <p>Just north of Crater Lake, in the Umpqua National Forest, you will find the Umpqua Hot Spring and Toketee Falls. Both places require a short hike, but the views are ones you won’t want to miss.</p>
