        <h6>The Oregon road trip is best done as a loop, and contains some of the most awe-inspiring scenery in the U.S. You can start from anywhere along the loop, but since we drive in from the east, we typically start in the Bend area. This road trip is easily broken into smaller sections and is hard to fit everything in unless you have 2 weeks or more, but we are going to show you all our favorite spots so you can pick what interests you the most. When visiting Oregon, we often take our bikes, kayaks, and plenty of hiking gear. No matter what journey you choose to take, it will be an epic experience that gives you plenty of memories!</h6>

                <h5>Deschutes County</h5>
                <h6>Bend</h6>
                <p>World-famous for its outdoor recreation and unspoiled beauty, Bend is a great place to spend a few days. Float the Deschutes River, hike Pilot Butte, explore the Lava River Cave, bike to Benham Falls, visit Tumalo Falls, or explore the magnificent city.</p>
                <p>To the south, visit Cascade Lakes National Scenic Byway. This 66-mile drive will take between 3 to 5 hours and is scattered with alpine lakes and snowcapped mountains. A favorite hike here is the Ray Atkson Loop Trail that is 2.3 miles long and located near Sparks Lake.</p>

                <h6>Sisters</h6>
                <p>The town of Sisters is full of lakes, mountains, and rivers. It is a paradise for hikers, fishermen, paddlers, bikers, skiers, and horseback riders. There is no shortage of places to explore here, and the town is full of culture, events, and mom-and-pop shops. Nearby visit the McKenzie Hwy where you can do a 2.2-mile waterfall loop hike and see Sahalie and Koosah Falls. We always like to visit Clear Lake and take a paddle on the crystal-clear water where you can easily view the forest preserved in the water.</p>
                <h6>Painted Hills & Smith Rock State Park</h6>
                <p>If you’re up for a drive, visit the nearby Painted Hills or Smith Rock State Park that will both stun you with their beauty. If you want a challenge, hike the 5.5-mile Misery Ridge Trail and experience the magnificent views of the valley and peaks of this gorgeous valley. </p>

                <h5>Rogue Valley</h5>

                <p>Known as the deepest lake in the U.S., Crater Lake will stun you with its blue water and surrounding beauty. There are multiple viewpoints, picnic areas, hiking trails, and a scenic rim drive. Cruise the lake on a boat cruise and visit the gift shop while you are here.</p>
                <p>Just north of Crater Lake, in the Umpqua National Forest, you will find the Umpqua Hot Spring and Toketee Falls. Both places require a short hike, but the views are ones you won’t want to miss.</p>

                <h5>Southern Oregon Coast</h5>
                <h6>Samuel H. Boardman Scenic Corridor</h6>
                <p>This treasure trove on the southern coast is just waiting to be explored with its secluded beaches, ancient trees, rocky coastline, and beautiful views. Just south of the corridor is the cute town of Brookings, where you can stock up for a day of adventuring. Heading north you will hit Harris Beach State Park, Cape Ferrelo, Whaleshead Beach, China Beach, Natural Bridges, and Secret Beach. There are numerous hiking trails, picnic areas, and sights to see along this beautiful 12-mile stretch.</p>
                <p>A few miles north you will find Gold Beach, a beautiful town with pristine sandy beaches and the Rogue River. There are plenty of opportunities here to explore town, go fishing or clam digging, take a jet boat tour, or spend some time at the beach.</p>

                <h6>Bandon</h6>
                <p>The beach town of Bandon is full of charm and history, has incredible views, and a thriving art community. There are numerous outdoor activities, from fishing, kayaking, hiking, biking, and golfing at a world-famous resort. Elephant Rock on the coast is a must-see attraction, and the historic Coquille River Lighthouse is the perfect backdrop to watch the sun set.</p>
                <p>South of Bandon is Port Orford, home of Cape Blanco State Park. This park features the oldest standing lighthouse on the Oregon coast, over eight miles of hiking trails, and a rugged coastline. To the north is the bustling port town of Coos Bay. This city has numerous recreational activities, some fun museums, and is the southern gateway to the Oregon Dunes!</p>

                <h5>Central Oregon Coast</h5>
                <h6>Florence</h6>
                <p>On the other end of the Oregon Dunes, you will find the cute town of Florence. While this area is best known for the dunes, it also has charming boutiques and antique shops, and the Umpqua Lighthouse, Heceta Head Lighthouse, and Sea Lion Caves nearby.  The Hobbit Beach Trail is worth the short but somewhat difficult walk, and a few miles north you will find Cape Perpetua with its famous Thor’s Well. The cute town of Yachats is a great place to explore tide pools, fish, and whale watch.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/dunes.png" alt="Oregon Dunes">
            <div class="places">
                <h6>Newport</h6>
                <p>The town is perfect for anyone who wants to have some fun. Take in the stunning architecture, visit a quaint shop, explore the Bayfront, and find the Yaquina Head Lighthouse at Agate Beach. There are plenty of trails for hiking and biking, a science center and aquarium, and an array of tours and experiences you can reserve. One of my favorite towns to the north, Depoe Bay, is the perfect place to Whale Watch or visit the local Whale Museum and shops.</p>
                <h6>Lincoln City</h6>
                <p>One of the biggest cities on the Oregon Coast is Lincoln City. Devil’s Lake provides numerous water activities here, you can take a glass art class, and nowhere in the U.S. is there a better place to fly a kite. If you want some adventure, Drift Creek Falls is a really fun 3-mile hike that goes over a super long foot bridge to a waterfall.</p>

                <h5>Northern Oregon Coast</h5>
                <h6>Tillamook</h6>
                <p>This is one of my favorite areas on the Oregon Coast. Tillamook is famous for the Tillamook Creamery, and it is definitely worth a stop (or more) when you are in the area. South of Tillamook is Three Capes Scenic Loop, which showcases three enormous rock outcroppings along the coast, Cape Kiwanda, Cape Lookout, and Cape Meares. All three are very different, so it’s important to do the whole loop, and don’t miss the Lighthouse and Octopus Tree at Cape Meares. To the north there is some fun little beach towns and Nehalem State Park where I recommend kayaking if that’s your thing.</p>

            <div class="places">
                <h6>Cannon Beach</h6>
                <p>One of the most visited places in Oregon is Haystack Rock at Cannon Beach.  The beach and rock were stunning, and so was the cute town. There are some fun recreational opportunities south of Cannon Beach at Oswald State Park and Hug Point. Some of my favorite trails in this area are Elk Flats Trail (2.9-miles), Short Sands Trail to Short Sand Beach (1.2-miles), and Hug Point Trail (1.2-miles).</p>
                <p>North of Cannon Beach is Ecola State Park, which is a fun place to explore and get a good view of the Tillamook Lighthouse. I recommend the Ecola Point to Crescent Beach Trail (1.25-miles), and the Clatsop Loop (2.8-miles) here. On the other side of this state park is the sweet town of Seaside. Everything is town is in walking distance, and if you like visiting cute little shops, you will love it here.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="places">
                <h6>Astoria</h6>
                <p>Nestled between the mouth of the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean is the small, charming city of Astoria. Visit Fort Astoria Park, explore the area on the paved Astoria Riverwalk, and drive across the famous Astoria Megler Bridge into Washington. Fort Stevens State Park is a must-see attraction with its gorgeous beaches, numerous hiking and biking trails, and the famous Peter Iredale Shipwreck.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/astoria.png" alt="Astoria Bridge">
            <div class="places">
                <h5>Willamette Valley</h5>
                <h6>Eugene/Salem</h6>
                <p>There is so much to do in the Willamette Valley, including shopping, outdoor recreation, fun events, and agritourism. This area is home to hundreds of covered bridges, a renowned growing region, and many local & state parks. Silver Falls State Park is an incredible place where you can do all or part of the 7.4-mile trail of ten falls, and the spring Tulip Festival will make you feel like you’re in The Netherlands.</p>
                <h6>Portland</h6>
                <p>This port city is the largest in the state of Oregon. There is so much to do here, including a visit to the Japanese Gardens, taking a dinner cruise, going to one of the numerous museums or parks, or exploring the outdoors. If you like vising cities, spend some time exploring this gorgeous area.</p>

            <div class="places">
                <h6>Columbia River Gorge & Mt Hood</h6>
                <p>The Columbia River Gorge is beautiful and while you can experience a lot of it from your car, but the best views are seen on foot. Latourell Falls is a 2-mile loop, Bridal Veil Falls is a steep 1-mile, and the short walk to the Mulnomah Falls Bridge is well worth it. My favorite hike in the gorge is the easy 2.4-mile hike to Wahclella Falls. I enjoy spending some time in Hood River and going south from there to view Mt.Hood. The 3.4-mile hike to Tamanawas Falls holds some gorgeous views of the wilderness, and we enjoy kayaking on either Laurance Lake (on the north) or Trillium Lake (on the south). There is so much to do and explore around Mt. Hood, and we recommend staying in either Parkdale or Mt. Hood Village if you want to spend a few days here.</p>
