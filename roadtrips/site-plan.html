        <h6>How to plan an amazing road trip</h6>
        <p>Plan your Route - 
            Decide where you want to go and what you want to see. Google Maps is a great tool for planning trips with multiple stops and tells you the approximate driving time between destinations. Researching things to do and top attractions along your route will help you maximize your vacation. I love to read travel blogs and visit Pinterest for ideas.
             - https://www.google.com/maps</p>
        <p>Set a Budget - 
            It’s helpful to know the approximate price of your flights and accommodations before making a budget to give you a starting point. Make sure to include the expense of a rental vehicle (if needed) and fuel costs. Allocate a budget for food and activities. I like to begin with what I hope to spend and try to stay within that amount, though sometimes I find the need to adjust based off our travel plans.</p>
        <p>Plan your Flights and Vehicle - 
            I like to find the cheapest airport before determining the start/end points of my road trip. Kayak is my go-to site for finding the best deals on flights, and lets you choose ‘nearby airports’ and ‘flexible dates’ to find the best deals. It also highlights the cheapest days to fly on their calendar, which is great if you can be flexible.
             - Flights - https://www.kayak.com/flights OR https://www.skyscanner.com/ 
             - Cars - https://www.kayak.com/cars OR https://www.rentalcars.com/us/ </p>
        <p>Book your Accommodations - 
            Once you have a route mapped out, decide where and how you want to stay each night. Pay special attention to the activities you want to do as they may lengthen your travel time or determine multiple stays in the same location. Some people prefer hotels, while others prefer to camp. I personally enjoy a mix of both if it is feasible. My favorite sites to book stays include:
             - Airbnb - https://www.airbnb.com/a/stays
             - Hotels - https://www.kayak.com/ OR https://booking.com/ OR https://hotels.com/ 
             - Camping - https://www.campingroadtrip.com/
             - Hostels - https://www.hostelworld.com/ </p>
        <p>Book your Activities - 
            I typically choose free activities when I travel, but I do enjoy splurging on a few must-see experiences each vacation. Make sure you book everything well in advance to ensure the dates all line up. Some great sites for finding and/or booking experiences are:
             - https://www.getyourguide.com/
             - https://www.withlocals.com/ 
             - https://www.google.com/travel/ 
             - https://www.pinterest.com/</p>
        <p>Pack - 
            Once you have everything booked and planned, it’s time to pack! Make sure you pack enough clothing for all possibilities of weather (and extra), toiletries, snacks, travel games/entertainment, and anything else you’d like to make your trip more enjoyable. I always bring my cooler full of snacks, cold drinks, and food that we restock at the grocery store to save money and eat healthier. You also may want to pack garbage bags, hand sanitizer, music, and a water bottle. It’s best to make yourself a checklist and start planning early so you don’t forget anything.</p>
        <p>Additional Tips
             - Make sure you pick a route that is feasible for the amount of time you have. You don’t want to feel rushed on your vacation or spend several long days driving for hours. Maximize your time by keeping the overall miles relatively low and putting your favorite attractions at the top of your list and working from there. I like to plan each day with must-see attractions along with other possibilities if we end up having time. You also want to leave a little room for spontaneity. You never know what you will find on the open road.
             - Spend time in both cities and outdoor recreation. One of the best parts about road tripping is the ability to see and do a variety of things. Don’t be afraid to step away from your norm and spend some time experiencing new things!
             - If you are driving your own car, make sure you prepare it before your trip by checking that everything is full and functioning properly. I always make sure I have a first aid kit and car maintenance kit with me when I travel.</p>
