    <p>Hi everyone! Let me introduce myself.</p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing certificates in computer programming and web development. I hope to either land an awesome job that I love in this field, or start my own business creating and/or managing websites for others.</p>
    <p>I am married with two wonderful children. We currently live in Pocatello, ID, where my husband is a Physical Therapist and I work from home managing Amazon accounts for several brands. My daughter (10) loves gymnastics, soccer, violin, dance, piano, and all things outdoors. My son passed away when he was 6.5 months old to SIDS, but we know he is doing what he needs to be doing and is cheering us on from there. As a family we love to travel, camp, kayak, hike, ski, and explore the world in every possible way.</p>
    <p>Both my husband and I were born members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and we are so grateful for it in our lives. I feel so uplifted when I read my scriptures, pray, listen to talks from the prophets and apostles, and attend my own church meetings. The church is definitely the center of our lives, and provides the foundation of who we are and why we do what we do.</p>
    <p>I am so excited to learn more this semester and grow both spiritually and academically. Education is something I treasure and I love that I have this amazing opportunity to continue learning and gaining new skills.</p>
