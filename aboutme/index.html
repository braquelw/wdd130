    <p>I’m currently looking for a job in Software Development or Website Management. I have a bachelor’s degree in Recreation Management and am currently working on certificates in Web & Computer Programming, Web Development, and Software Development. I am organized and innovative with the ability to communicate clearly and effectively. I improve my job environment by enhancing processes and being positive while leading teams and managing accounts. I work hard and efficiently, always putting those I serve first and seeking to give them the best experience possible.
