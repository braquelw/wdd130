            The Salmon River is 425 miles of pure wilderness adventure in Idaho. As one of the last undammed mountain rivers on the continent, it courses wildly through stunning scenery including a gorge deeper than the Grand Canyon, giving the Salmon the rightful nickname of “The River of No Return”. Bountiful wildlife including Bighorn Sheep, Elk, Deer, Black Bear, Bald Eagles, and other species can be found along the river and in the mountains above.<br><br>A river trip on the Salmon involves giant rollercoaster rapids, picturesque scenery, vast white sand beaches, calm green pools, warm days with cooler nights, and ideal conditions for a great time. The Salmon river offers a variety of options for all comfort-levels of white water rafting. There are runs providing mellow and fun experiences, as well as trips for those seeking thrilling high adventure excitement. June and July typically have higher water flows offering a bit more adventure, while by August the levels usually drop and are preferred by younger families and multi-generational groups.

        <h1>A Rich History</h1>
        <p>The Salmon River’s history runs deep and is packed with wild stories of rugged men and women. The area thrives with the kind of culture and heritage that made the west legendary.<br><br>
        Lewis and Clark described the Salmon River in 1805 as “foaming and roaring through rocks in every direction”. Nearly 50 years later gold was discovered, bringing an abundance of prospective miners to the area. While they didn’t find much gold, they did manage to explore and catalog the canyons giving us some heroic tales of survival.
